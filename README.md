# Machine Learning Project
This is a a repository of my machine learning project for my machine learning course. 
This project will attempt to predict the likeability of an instagram post. So what makes an instagram post more popular? 
Instagram is a very powerful platform and a lot of today's trends are influenced by instagram. As social networks and content-sharing continue to grow rapidly in size and volume, predicting the popularity of social media content has become an important social problem with many potential applications.
This will be done by using an XGBoost Regression Model and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. 
This project is inspired by the work of Guilherme Regos Zamorano and Corentin Dugué
